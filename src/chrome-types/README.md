# Chrome types

This is an auto-generated directory containing the types for the Chrome extension API, downloaded from the `@types/chrome` package.

The root declaration file has been automatically patched to export a type named `Chrome` instead of declaring the global `chrome` namespace on `window`.

To re-download the types, run `bun download-chrome-types`.
